# Log an Interrupt

Quickly log an interrupt to today's daily plan. Faster than the full interrupt agent for minor disruptions.

**Argument**: Description of the interrupt (required)

## Process

1. Read `context/active/daily.md`
2. If the file doesn't exist, tell the user to run morning-triage first
3. Find the `## Interrupts` section
4. Append a new line with the current timestamp and the user's description:
   ```
   - [HH:MM] Interrupt: <description> [est: ?h, actual: ?h]
   ```
5. Update the `## Capacity Today` section: reduce remaining hours by 0.25h (minimum interrupt cost)
6. Save the file

## Output

Confirm the interrupt was logged. Show updated remaining capacity.
