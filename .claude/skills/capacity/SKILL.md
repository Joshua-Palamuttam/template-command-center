# Quick Capacity Check

Show remaining capacity today and this week. Flag overcommitment.

## Process

1. Read `context/active/daily.md` — extract committed hours and remaining hours
2. Read `context/active/weekly.md` — extract weekly committed vs available hours
3. Calculate:
   - Hours remaining today (available minus committed)
   - Hours remaining this week (weekly available minus weekly committed)
   - Overcommitment flag if committed > available at either level

## Output Format

```
**Today**: Xh committed / Yh available → Zh remaining [or OVERCOMMITTED by Zh]
**This week**: Xh committed / Yh available → Zh remaining [or OVERCOMMITTED by Zh]
```

If either plan file is missing, say so and suggest running the appropriate agent.
