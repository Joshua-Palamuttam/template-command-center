# Command Center

## Session Bootstrap

**Before doing anything else**, read `config.yaml` in the repository root. This file contains all personal configuration: user identity, GitHub org, Jira projects, Confluence spaces, Slack channels, team structure, capacity defaults, and estimation multipliers. Every agent and process in this workspace references config values loaded from this file.

If `config.yaml` does not exist, tell the user to copy `config.example.yaml` to `config.yaml` and fill in their values.

## What This Is

This is the operational hub for a senior/principal software engineer. It is NOT a code repository. It is where you come to think, plan, gather context, and stay accountable.

Every session in this workspace should start by checking for today's daily plan.

## Role Context

The user's identity and organizational context are defined in `config.yaml`:
- **Name, role, organization**: `config.yaml: user.*`
- **Slack display name**: `config.yaml: user.slack_display_name` — use this when searching for DMs and @mentions
- **GitHub org and repositories**: `config.yaml: github.*`
- **Jira project keys**: `config.yaml: jira.projects[]` — each entry has a key, name, description, and ticket pattern
- **Confluence spaces**: `config.yaml: confluence.spaces[]` — each entry has a key, name, and description

## Accountability Loop

**At the start of EVERY session**, do the following before anything else:

1. Check if a daily plan exists at `context/active/daily.md`
2. Check if a weekly plan exists at `context/active/weekly.md`
3. If both exist: briefly summarize daily progress (items done/total), weekly capacity (hours committed/available), and the top priority. Ask if priorities have shifted.
4. If the daily plan is missing, suggest running the morning-triage agent.
5. If the weekly plan is missing, suggest running the weekly-plan agent.

This is non-negotiable. The daily plan keeps you focused. The weekly plan keeps you honest about capacity.

## Capacity Model

Defaults are defined in `config.yaml: capacity`. Use those values unless the user provides different numbers:

- **Daily productive hours**: `capacity.daily_productive_hours` (not 8 — meetings, Slack, context switching)
- **Weekly productive hours**: `capacity.weekly_productive_hours`
- **Meeting overhead**: `capacity.meeting_overhead` per week (adjust based on actual calendar)
- **Slack/comms overhead**: `capacity.slack_overhead` per week
- **Context switching**: `capacity.context_switching` per week
- **Interrupt buffer**: `capacity.interrupt_buffer` per week (non-negotiable — interrupts are guaranteed)

When assessing whether something fits in the schedule, always use the realistic capacity, never the theoretical 40h.

## Estimation Philosophy

**The user chronically underestimates task duration.** Every estimate must account for this:

1. Break tasks into subtasks including "hidden work" (PR review cycles, merge conflicts, Slack alignment, deploy verification)
2. Apply multipliers from `config.yaml: estimation.multipliers` based on familiarity:
   - Familiar code + clear requirements: `estimation.multipliers.familiar_clear`
   - Familiar code + unclear requirements: `estimation.multipliers.familiar_unclear`
   - Unfamiliar code + clear requirements: `estimation.multipliers.unfamiliar_clear`
   - Unfamiliar code + unclear requirements: `estimation.multipliers.unfamiliar_unclear`
   - System never touched: `estimation.multipliers.never_touched`
3. Never give best-case as the timeline. Always communicate the realistic estimate.
4. Track actuals vs estimates in the weekly plan to calibrate over time.

When the user says "it should only take X hours" — that's the bias. Ask them to walk through the subtasks. The breakdown always reveals more work.

## Weekly Plan File Format

The current weekly plan is at `context/active/weekly.md`. Previous weeks are archived to `context/archive/YYYY/MM/weekly/YYYY-WNN.md`. See the weekly-plan agent for the full format. Key sections:
- Capacity calculation
- Committed work with estimates and actuals
- Stretch goals (not commitments)
- Estimation accuracy tracker
- Interrupts log

## Slack Channel Map

Channel names and descriptions are defined in `config.yaml: slack.channels`, organized by category:

- **Product** (`slack.channels.product`): Product health and customer-facing issues
- **Engineering** (`slack.channels.engineering`): What the team is building
- **Operations** (`slack.channels.operations`): Infrastructure, incidents, deployments
- **General** (`slack.channels.general`): Company-wide and system alerts

Agents use these categories for priority ordering. Operations channels are checked first (incidents have highest urgency), then product, then engineering, then general.

## Jira Context

Jira projects are defined in `config.yaml: jira.projects[]`. Each project has:
- A `key` used in JQL queries (e.g., `project = <key>`)
- A `ticket_pattern` showing the ID format
- A `name` and `description` for context

When reviewing tickets, always check for linked Confluence docs, linked tickets, and recent comments.

## Confluence Context

Confluence spaces are defined in `config.yaml: confluence.spaces[]`. Each space has:
- A `name` used in CQL queries (e.g., `space = "<name>"`)
- A `description` of what lives there

## Quarterly Goals

The user's team structure is defined in `config.yaml: teams[]`. Each team maps to a Jira project and Confluence space for goal tracking.

Goals file: `context/active/goals.md` (archived to `context/archive/YYYY/QN/goals.md` on quarter rollover)

**Mid-quarter goal additions are normal.** When new goals appear:
1. Run the quarterly-goals agent to assess capacity impact
2. Log the change in the scope change log
3. Communicate what gets displaced

Weekly plans should always reference quarterly goals. If a weekly plan has no hours mapped to an at-risk goal, flag it.

## Calendar Integration

Meeting data comes from the user's calendar via browser automation.
- Calendar provider and URL are defined in `config.yaml: calendar`
- Calendar file: `context/active/calendar.md` (archived to `context/archive/YYYY/MM/calendar/YYYY-WNN.md`)
- Run the `calendar-sync` agent to refresh from the calendar
- Morning triage and weekly planning use this for real capacity numbers instead of guesses
- If the calendar file is stale (older than the current week), suggest re-syncing

## Estimation Calibration

The system learns over time. Estimation accuracy data lives in `context/calibration.md`.
- Tracks actual vs estimated hours per task
- Adjusts multipliers as data accumulates (low/medium/high confidence thresholds)
- Tracks a weekly pace factor to account for energy, focus, and mental load variations
- The estimate agent reads this file before every estimation

**Pace factor**: Some weeks are slower and that's fine. The system doesn't judge — it adjusts. A pace factor of 0.8 means "this week, things are taking 25% longer than normal" and estimates are adjusted accordingly.

## Tool Usage

This workspace leverages MCP integrations:
- **Atlassian**: For Jira and Confluence (read tickets, search, read docs)
- **Slack**: For channel reading, thread reading, and sending messages
- **Figma**: For design context when reviewing UI-related work
- **Chrome**: For reading the calendar and other browser-based tasks

When using these tools, always prefer structured summaries over raw dumps. Extract what matters, flag what needs attention, and skip the noise.

## Active vs Archive File Structure

Current plans live in `context/active/` with fixed filenames:
- `context/active/daily.md` — today's plan
- `context/active/weekly.md` — this week's plan
- `context/active/calendar.md` — this week's calendar
- `context/active/goals.md` — current quarter's goals

Historical files are archived under `context/archive/` organized by year/month:
- `context/archive/YYYY/MM/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — archived daily plans
- `context/archive/YYYY/MM/weekly/YYYY-WNN.md` — archived weekly plans
- `context/archive/YYYY/MM/calendar/YYYY-WNN.md` — archived calendar data
- `context/archive/YYYY/QN/goals.md` — archived quarterly goals (quarter-scoped)

**Archive process** (built into existing agents, no separate agent needed):
- **Morning triage**: Before creating today's plan, checks if `context/active/daily.md` is from a previous day. If so, moves it to `context/archive/YYYY/MM/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, then creates a fresh `context/active/daily.md`.
- **Weekly plan**: Before creating this week's plan, archives `context/active/weekly.md` to `context/archive/YYYY/MM/weekly/YYYY-WNN.md` and `context/active/calendar.md` to `context/archive/YYYY/MM/calendar/YYYY-WNN.md`.
- **Quarterly goals**: On quarter rollover, archives `context/active/goals.md` to `context/archive/YYYY/QN/goals.md`.

Cross-quarter data (`context/calibration.md`, `context/notes/`) stays in place — not archived.

## Daily Plan File Format

The current daily plan is at `context/active/daily.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# Daily Plan - YYYY-MM-DD

## Capacity Today
- Available hours: Xh (after meetings)
- Committed: Xh
- Remaining: Xh

## DMs and @Mentions
- [ ] @person — summary of what they need (DM / #channel mention) [est: Xh]

## Top Priorities
1. [ ] Priority item (WHY: reason, WHO is waiting) [est: Xh]
2. [ ] Priority item (WHY: reason, DEADLINE: date) [est: Xh]

```

## Code Review Workflow

When reviewing PRs, the full context flow is:
1. Use `pr-context` agent to gather Jira ticket + design doc + Slack discussion
2. Switch to the worktree environment: `wt-review <PR#>` in the relevant repo
3. After review, come back here to update daily plan / respond on Slack if needed

## Writing Style

Be direct. No fluff. Bullet points over paragraphs. When summarizing docs or tickets, lead with the decision or action needed, then provide supporting context.
