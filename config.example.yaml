# ─── Slack Channels ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Organize channels by category. Agents use categories for priority ordering:
# operations channels are checked first (incidents), then product (customer impact),
# then engineering (team work), then general.

slack:
  channels:
    product:                            # Product health and customer-facing issues
      - name: "product-issues"
        description: "Product bugs and customer-facing issues"
      - name: "product-updates"
        description: "Product announcements and changes"

    engineering:                         # What the team is building
      - name: "engineering-general"
        description: "Engineering discussion and announcements"
      - name: "pr-reviews"
        description: "PR review requests and discussions"
      - name: "backend-devs"
        description: "Backend engineering discussion"

    operations:                          # Infrastructure and operations
      - name: "ops-alerts"
        description: "Operational alerts and incidents"
      - name: "deployments"

        description: "System alerts and monitoring"

# ─── Teams ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# If you're on multiple teams with separate goal tracking, list them here.
# Used by the quarterly-goals and weekly-plan agents.

teams:
  - name: "Product Team"
    jira_project: "PROJ"                # Maps to jira.projects[].key
    confluence_space: "Main Product"    # Maps to confluence.spaces[].name
  - name: "Infrastructure Team"
    jira_project: "INFRA"
    confluence_space: "Infrastructure"

# ─── Capacity Model ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Realistic capacity defaults. Adjust based on your actual schedule.
# These are starting points — the system calibrates over time.

capacity:
  daily_productive_hours: "5-6"         # Not 8 — meetings, Slack, context switching
  weekly_productive_hours: "22-24"
  meeting_overhead: "8-10"              # Hours/week (adjust based on actual calendar)
  slack_overhead: 3                     # Hours/week
  context_switching: 2                  # Hours/week
  interrupt_buffer: 3                   # Hours/week (non-negotiable — interrupts are guaranteed)

# ─── Estimation Multipliers ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Applied to gut-feel estimates to produce realistic timelines.
# These are defaults — the calibration system adjusts them over time
# as you track actuals vs estimates.

estimation:
  multipliers:
    familiar_clear: 1.5                 # Familiar code + clear requirements
    familiar_unclear: 1.75              # Familiar code + unclear requirements
    unfamiliar_clear: 2.0               # Unfamiliar code + clear requirements
    unfamiliar_unclear: 2.5             # Unfamiliar code + unclear requirements
    never_touched: 3.0                  # System you've never worked in

# ─── Calendar ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

calendar:
  provider: "outlook"                   # "outlook" or "google" — used by calendar-sync agent
  url: "https://outlook.office.com/calendar/view/workweek"  # Calendar URL for browser automation

# ─── Template Sync ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# If you use a private instance with the public template as an upstream remote,
# configure which agents are private (not synced to the public template).

template:
  private_agents:                       # Agents that should NOT sync to the public template
    # - "my-custom-workflow"            # Example: agent only relevant to your setup
    # - "team-specific-process"         # Example: agent with org-specific process
