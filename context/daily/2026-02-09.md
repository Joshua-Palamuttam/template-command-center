# Daily Plan - 2026-02-09 (Monday)

## Capacity Today
- Available hours: ~4h (assuming ~2h meetings on Monday, no calendar data)
- Committed: 5h
- Remaining: -1h (overcommitted — need to cut or defer)
- **Calendar data missing** — suggest running calendar-sync to get real numbers

## DMs and @Mentions
- [ ] Sudharshan + Justin — monitoring/alerting debate (Datadog vs App Insights/Azure Monitor). Sudharshan favors starting with App Insights; Justin advocates Datadog. Needs alignment decision. (group DM) [est: 0.5h]

## Top Priorities
1. [ ] Verify AI Screening/Submit fix + resume visibility (WHY: AI1099-2770 is still To Do assigned to Ryan Moore — UI issue preventing candidates from being added to Presentation after AI Screening. AI1099-2771 resume fix is In Progress by Ryan. Elsa Moreno had client deliverable blocked Friday. Check with Ryan on status.) [est: 0.5h]
2. [ ] Review Sudharshan's PR #1607 — Move Quartz job scheduling from Api to Core (WHY: he asked for review Friday, blocking his work) [est: 1h]
3. [ ] AI1099-2766: Implement DLQ + exception alerts for Spot Alerts channel (WHY: new ticket assigned to you, directly relates to the monitoring/alerting discussion with Sudharshan & Justin) [est: 1h to scope, more to implement]
4. [ ] AI1099-2678 / PR #1600 — Move rejected inbound candidates to DoNotContact (WHY: In Review status, posted Friday, needs Sudharshan's review to merge) [est: 0.25h follow-up]
5. [ ] Progress on AI1099-2687 (UCR in Spot), AI1099-2684 (MCP Test Harness), AI1099-2682 (MCP Eval with Runtime API) — all In Progress [est: 1h combined check-in/advance]

## Carried Forward
- [ ] RUN-1526: Profile data dump (Epic, To Do) [est: scope TBD]

## Slack Threads Needing Response
- #spot-product-issues — Camille Mullins: resume uploaded but not visible in presentation (from Feb 6 4:40 PM) — likely AI1099-2771
- #spot-product-issues — Swatee Paithankar: can see replies on Spot but not in Outlook (from Feb 6 12:44 AM)

- **Active team work:** RUN-2204/2205 (Enterprise Field Cache), RUN-2203 (Unit tests), RUN-2177 (Powerfilter to prod), multiple migration tasks (Prashi)

## Runtime Awareness (no direct action needed yet)
- Memory issues on runtime prod — instances restarted around 5:30 AM Friday. Prashi investigating, pushing for .NET 8 migration.
- E2E tests failing in ISEC-staging — Philip investigating, likely data issue.
- Krishnamurthy investigating Npgsql/LinqToDB exceptions on app service local run.
- Philip adjusted alert threshold sensitivity to "low" to reduce false positives.
- Prashi submitted multiple migration PRs (backend PRs #4658-4671).

## Meetings Today
- Unknown — no calendar data. Run calendar-sync agent.

## Notes
- No weekly plan exists for W07. Create one after triage.
- No quarterly goals file exists. Consider setting up.
- CLAUDE.md has wrong project key — should be AI1099, not AI-1099.
