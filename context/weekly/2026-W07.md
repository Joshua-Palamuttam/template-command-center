## Quarterly Goal Alignment
| Goal | Status | Hours This Week | Notes |
|------|--------|----------------|-------|
| UCR Implementation (AI1099-2687) | In Progress | 2h | Highest priority — active dev |
| DLQ + Alerting (AI1099-2766) | To Do | 1h | Align approach at Wed Alerts Review with Raj |
| SeekOut MCP (CTO directive) | Not Started | 0.5h | Tue status check with Yura — update only, no dev time |
| Runtime (RUN-1526) | To Do | 0h | No capacity this week |

**Flag:** MCP goal gets 0 dev hours this week. CTO directive but OOO eats capacity. Plan to pick up next week (W08, back Wednesday Feb 18).
